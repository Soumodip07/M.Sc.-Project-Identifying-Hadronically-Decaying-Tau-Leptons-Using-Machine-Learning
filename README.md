# M.Sc. Project: Identifying Hadronically Decaying Tau Leptons Using Machine Learning

This repository presents the complete workflow for classifying hadronically decaying tau jets versus light quark jets in high-energy physics using **jet image-based representation** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The analysis leverages simulated $e^+e^-$ collision events and evaluates performance across multiple center-of-mass energies.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

**Tau lepton identification** is crucial for both **precision Standard Model (SM) measurements** and **searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM)**.

A central motivation stems from **Higgs boson analyses**:
- The Higgs decays to tau lepton pairs ($H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$) with a branching ratio of ~**6.3%**, making it a key channel for probing **Yukawa couplings**.
- Hadronic tau decays, constituting ~**65%** of all tau decays, are challenging to isolate from quark-induced jets.
- Effective tau tagging is critical for **$H \to \tau\tau$** reconstruction, as well as identifying **new physics signatures** involving tau leptons.

This project investigates CNN-based image classification to distinguish **tau jets** from **light quark jets**, using simulated data from:
- $e^+e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ (tau jets)
- $e^+e^- \to jj$ (light quark jets, $j = u,d,s,c,\bar{u},\bar{d},\bar{s},\bar{c}$)
